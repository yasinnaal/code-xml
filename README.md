### XML (Working with XML and XML files)

Maybe it is a hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything !. Ref# w3school

```xml
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

Note to Tove from Jani, Don't forget me this weekend! stored as XML

#### Note
To: Tove
From: Jani

#### Reminder
Don't forget me this weekend!

#### XML Syntax Rules

XML Documents Must Have a Root Element
XML documents must contain one root element that is the parent of all other elements:

```xml
<root>
  <child>
    <subchild>.....</subchild>
  </child>
</root>
```
